# This service must run in HTTPS mode.

The oidc-provider interaction requries cookies to be passed around and the response
from B2C is https so the cookie passed back to the client must be secure too.

## Generating the certificates

The localhost.pem and localhost-key.pem files are generated by running:

```bash
# install and register the root CA
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install

# in the certs folder create the certificate
mkcert localhost
```
